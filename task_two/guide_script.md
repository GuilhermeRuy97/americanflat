## Step-by-Step Guide for Generating Vendor Weekly Sales Report

### 1. Obtain and Refresh Authorization Tokens
- **Login With Amazon (LWA) Access Token**: Acquire a valid LWA token using `client_id`, `client_secret`, and `refresh_token` from your Amazon Developer profile. Authorization may be required to create an app for data access.

### 2. Identify Report Type and Endpoints
- **SP-API Documentation**: Locate the correct report type for Vendor Weekly Sales.
- **Endpoints and Marketplace IDs**: Determine necessary endpoints and target marketplace IDs.

### 3. Request the Report
- **POST /reports/2021-06-30/reports**: Submit a request for the Vendor Weekly Sales Report.
  - Include `reportType` (e.g., "GET_VENDOR_SALES_REPORT"), `startDate`, `endDate`, and `marketplaceIds`.

### 4. Poll for Report Status
- **GET /reports/2021-06-30/reports/{reportId}**: Use the `reportId` to check the report's `processingStatus` until it is `DONE`.
  - Handle `IN_QUEUE`, `IN_PROGRESS`, and `CANCELED` states by waiting and re-checking.
  - Log and handle `FATAL` errors appropriately.

### 5. Retrieve the Report Document
- **GET /reports/2021-06-30/documents/{reportDocumentId}**: Obtain the `reportDocumentId` and fetch the report document metadata.
  - Download the report using the pre-signed URL provided.

### 6. Download and Process the Report
- **Download**: Retrieve the file from the URL.
- **Decrypt/Decode**: If necessary, decrypt or decompress the document as per metadata instructions.
- **Parse and Store**: Process the CSV/JSON data and store it in a data warehouse (e.g., BigQuery).

### 7. Transform and Integrate Data
- **Data Transformation**: Modify data as needed and integrate it into internal systems.
- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling for token expiration, throttling, network errors, and data validation.

## Considerations
- **Token Expiration**: Refresh LWA token when expired.
- **Throttling**: Use exponential backoff for retries.
- **Network Errors**: Gracefully handle connection issues.
- **Invalid Credentials**: Verify IAM policies and credentials.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure data structure integrity before processing.

## Possible Metrics
- CTR, Profit, Sales, Cost, Views, Impressions, Clicks, CPC, TACoS, ROAS, Refund Rate, Sales Rank, Keywords Rank, Inventory.

## Future Improvements
- **Option 1**: Use BigQuery and Streamlit for a web app hosted on Google Cloud Run.
- **Option 2**: Create dashboards with Power BI online.
